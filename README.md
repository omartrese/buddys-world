# buddys-world
here is the game's source code

## How to SET-UP

First you need to have installed UNITY (link: ***https://unity.com/download***)

I developed this game on the Unity version *2021.3.11f1*. I don't know how it works on old versions but I recommend you use that version or higher

Then you need to have downloaded the project, you can do it ***downloading the zip and descompressing it*** or ***cloning the project***

If you want to download the ZIP click on **code** and **Download ZIP**

Then you have to descompress the ZIP and open the directory on UNITY HUB (you need to have installed unity hub to manage your unity projects)

The other form is ***cloning the project***

To do this you have to click on **code** and below you have the URL that you need to copy
and with this URL you write this command in your terminal (obviously having git installed ***https://git-scm.com/downloads***)

```
git clone https://github.com/omartrese/buddys-world.git
```

And the same, you need to open the dir on UNITY HUB and then you can open the project

You are free to modify this game all you want, see how it works, etc.
