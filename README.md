# buddys-world
here is the game's source code

## How to SET-UP

First you need to have installed UNITY
I developed this game on the Unity version *2021.3.11f1*. I don't know how it works on old versions but I recommend you use that version or higher

Then you need to have downloaded the project, you can do it *downloading the zip and descompressing it* or *cloning the project*

If you want to download the ZIP click on **code** and **Download ZIP**

The other form is cloning the project
To do this you have to click on **code** and below you have the URL that you need to copy
and with this URL you do this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/omartrese/buddys-world.git
```
You are free to modify in this game all you want, see how it works, etc.
